Immutable objects (like strings and tuples) cannot be altered once created, ensuring data integrity and facilitating hash-based operations. For example, a list [1, 2, 3] can be modified with list[0] = 4, whereas a string \"hello\" cannot be changed directly\n",

For loops iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and are useful for when the number of iterations is known. While loops execute as long as a condition is true, making them suitable for situations where the number of iterations isn't predetermined. For example, for i in range(5): print(i) prints numbers 0 to 4, and while x < 5: x += 1 increments x until it reaches 5."
